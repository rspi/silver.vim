# silver.vim #

This plug-in is my version of a wrapper around [ag - The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), and my first attempt at vimscript.
I really liked the output of the CLI version of [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and wanted the same inside vim.

## Installation ##

You have to first install [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) itself.
Then install the plug-in as usual, using something like [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

### Usage ###

Search recursively from the current directory using the following command:

    :SS {pattern}

## Documentation ##

See `:h silver`
